# Speed Snitch Agent
This repo includes the source for our Speed Snitch agent which we use to monitor and report on internet speeds
at remote locations. The agent communicates with a management API to receive configuration details related to Tasks 
(speed tests, latency tests, etc.). 

This project is in an early prototyping phase though so it is not a fully functional solution yet. There will eventually 
be `speed-snitch-admin-api` and `speed-snitch-admin-ui` projects as well for the central management capabilities.
